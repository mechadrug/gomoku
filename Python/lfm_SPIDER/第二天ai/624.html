<p style="text-indent:0em"><strong>Abstract</strong>: Sight and sound are two of the most important senses for human perception. From cognitive perspective, the visual and auditory information is actually slightly discrepant, but the percept is unified with multi-sensory integration. What's more, when there are multiple input senses, human reactions usually perform more exactly or efficiently than single sense. Inspired by this, for computational models, our community has begun to explore marrying computer vision with audition, and targets to address some essential problems of audio-visual learning then further develops them into interesting and worthwhile tasks. In this talk, I will give a short-review of recent progress in learning from both visual and auditory data, especially audio-visual self-supervised learning and its generalization in scene understanding.</p>

<p style="text-indent:0em"><strong><strong style="white-space:normal">Prof. </strong>Xin Gao</strong>, Professor, Computer Science, KAUST</p> 
<p style="text-indent:0em"><strong>Abstract</strong>: COVID-19 has caused a global pandemic and become the most urgent threat to the entire world. Tremendous efforts and resources have been invested in developing diagnosis, yet the pandemic is still undergoing.</p> 
<p style="text-indent:2em">Despite the various, urgent advances in developing artificial intelligence (AI)-based computer-aided systems for CT-based COVID-19 diagnosis, most of the existing methods can only perform classification, whereas the state-of-the-art segmentation methods require high levels of human intervention. In this talk, I will introduce our work on a fully-automatic, rapid, accurate, and machine-agnostic method that can segment and quantify the infection regions on CT scans from different sources. Our method is founded upon three innovations: 1) an embedding method that projects any arbitrary CT scan to a same, standard space, so that the trained model becomes robust and generalizable; 2) the first CT scan simulator for COVID-19, by fitting the dynamic change of real patients’ data measured at different time points, which greatly alleviates the data scarcity issue; and 3) a novel deep learning algorithm to solve the large-scene-small-object problem, which decomposes the 3D segmentation problem into three 2D ones, and thus reduces the model complexity by an order of magnitude and, at the same time, significantly improves the segmentation accuracy. Comprehensive experimental results over multi-country, multi-hospital, and multi-machine datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method over the existing ones and suggest its important application value in combating the disease. I will finally introduce our ongoing work on developing full interpretable AI models to “see the unseen” from the CT scans of COVID-19 survivors to diagnose the long-term sequela of COVID-19.</p>

<p style="text-indent:0em"><strong><strong style="white-space:normal">Prof. </strong>Hongteng Xu</strong>, Tenure- Track Associate Professor, GSAI</p> 
<p style="text-indent:0em"><strong>Abstract</strong>: Many real-world data like PPI networks and biological molecules are structured data, which are represented as (attributed) graphs. From the viewpoint of machine learning, the tasks focusing on these structured data, such as network alignment and molecule analysis, can often be formulated as graph matching, partitioning, and node embedding problems. In this talk, I will introduce a novel machine learning framework called Gromov-Wasserstein Learning (GWL) — a new systematic solution I proposed for structured data analysis. The GWL framework is based on a pseudo-metric on graphs called Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) discrepancy. Given two arbitrary graphs, their GW discrepancy measures how the edges in a graph compare to those in the other graph, which corresponds to learning an optimal transport matching one graph's nodes with those of the other. Besides graph matching, this framework is applicable for graph partitioning and node embedding. A scalable GWL method is developed, combining a recursive partition mechanism with a proximal point algorithm.</p>

<p style="text-indent:0em"><strong>Abstract</strong>:Network communication is a major bottleneck in large-scale Distributed Deep Learning. The Computer Systems group at KAUST is building systems to minimize the communication cost and reduce the end-to-end training time. This talk will introduce four such systems: (i) SwitchML, an in-network aggregation approach that utilizes programmable switches (e.g., Barefoot Tofino) to average and broadcast the stochastic gradients among the distributed workers; (ii) GRACE, a programming framework that simplifies the implementation of compressed communication (both quantization and sparsification) on TensorFlow and PyTorch; (iii) OmniReduce, a novel implementation of AllReduce, optimized for sparse tensors in very fast networks; and (iv) DeepReduce, a Bloom filter-based compression method for sparse tensors, suitable for WANs and large-scale Federated Learning.</p>

<p style="text-indent:0em"><strong>Abstract:</strong> Harnessing data to model and discover complex physical systems has become a critical scientific problem in many science and engineering areas. The state-of-the-art advances of AI (in particular deep learning, thanks to its rich representations for learning complex nonlinear functions) have great potential to tackle this challenge, but in general (i) rely on a large amount of rich data to train a robust model, (ii) have generalization and extrapolation issues, and (iii) lack of interpretability and explainability, with little physical meaning. To bridge the knowledge gaps between AI and complex physical systems in the sparse/small data regime, this talk will introduce the integration of bottom-up (data-driven) and top-down (physics-based) processes through a Physics-informed Learning and Reasoning paradigm for discovery of discrete and continuous dynamical systems. This talk will discuss several methods that fuse deep learning and symbolic reasoning for data-driven discovery of mathematical equations (e.g., nonlinear ODEs/PDEs) that govern the behavior of complex physical systems, e.g., chaotic systems, reaction-diffusion processes, wave propagation, fluid flows, etc.</p>

<p style="text-indent:0em"><strong><strong style="white-space:normal">Prof. </strong>Zhewei Wei</strong>, Tenured Associate Professor, GSAI</p> 
<p style="text-indent:0em"><strong>Abstract</strong>: Many representative graph neural networks, e.g., GPRGNN and ChebNet, approximate graph convolutions with graph spectral filters. However, existing work either applies predefined filter weights or learns them without necessary constraints, which may lead to oversimplified or ill-posed filters. To overcome these issues, we propose BernNet, a novel graph neural network with theoretical support that provides a simple but effective scheme for designing and learning arbitrary graph spectral filters. In particular, for any filter over the normalized Laplacian spectrum of a graph, our BernNet estimates it by an order-K Bernstein polynomial approximation and designs its spectral property by setting the coefficients of the Bernstein basis. Moreover, we can learn the coefficients (and the corresponding filter weights) based on observed graphs and their associated signals and thus achieve the BernNet specialized for the data. Our experiments demonstrate that BernNet can learn arbitrary spectral filters, including complicated band-rejection and comb filters, and it achieves superior performance in real-world graph modeling tasks.</p>

<p style="text-indent:0em"><strong><strong style="white-space:normal">Prof. </strong>Weiran Shen</strong>, Tenure-Track Assistant Professor, GSAI</p> 
<p style="text-indent:0em"><strong>Abstract:</strong> A decision maker looks to take an active action (e.g., purchase some goods or make an investment). The payoff of this active action depends on his own private type as well as a random and unknown state of nature. To decide between this active action and another passive action, which always leads to a safe constant utility, the decision maker may purchase information from an information seller. The seller can access the realized state of nature, and this information is useful for the decision maker (i.e., the information buyer) to better estimate his payoff from the active action.We study the seller’s problem of designing a revenue-optimal pricing scheme to sell her information to the buyer. Suppose the buyer's private type and the state of nature are drawn from two independent distributions, we fully characterize the optimal pricing mechanism for the seller in closed form. Specifically, under a natural linearity assumption of the buyer payoff function, we show that an optimal pricing mechanism is the threshold mechanism which charges each buyer type some upfront payment and then reveals whether the realized state is above some threshold or below it. The payment and the threshold are generally different for different buyer types, and are carefully tailored to accommodate the different amount of risks each buyer type can take. The proof of our results relies on novel techniques and concepts, such as upper/lower virtual values and their mixtures, which may be of independent interest.</p>

<p style="text-indent:0em"><strong><strong style="white-space:normal">Prof. </strong> Peter Richtárik</strong>, Professor, Computer Science, KAUST</p> 
<p style="text-indent:0em"><strong>Abstract: </strong>First proposed by Seide et al (2014) as a heuristic, error feedback (EF) is a very popular mechanism for enforcing convergence of distributed gradient-based optimization methods enhanced with communication compression strategies based on the application of contractive compression operators. However, existing theory of EF relies on very strong assumptions (e.g., bounded gradients), and provides pessimistic convergence rates (e.g., while the best known rate for EF in the smooth nonconvex regime, and when full gradients are compressed, is O(1/T^{2/3}), the rate of gradient descent in the same regime is O(1/T). Recently, Richt\'{a}rik et al (2021) proposed a new error feedback mechanism, EF21, based on the construction of a Markov compressor induced by a contractive compressor. EF21 removes the aforementioned theoretical deficiencies of EF and at the same time works better in practice. In this work we propose six practical extensions of EF21: partial participation, stochastic approximation, variance reduction, proximal setting, momentum and bidirectional compression. Our extensions are supported by strong convergence theory in the smooth nonconvex and also Polyak-Łojasiewicz regimes. Several of these techniques were never analyzed in conjunction with EF before, and in cases where they were (e.g., bidirectional compression), our rates are vastly superior.</p>

His lab's Deep Learning Neural Networks based on ideas published in the "Annus Mirabilis" 1990-1991 have revolutionised machine learning and AI. By the mid 2010s, they were on 3 billion devices, and used billions of times per day through users of the world's most valuable public companies, e.g., for greatly improved (CTC-LSTM-based) speech recognition on all Android phones, greatly improved machine translation through Google Translate and Facebook (over 4 billion LSTM-based translations per day), Apple's Siri and Quicktype on all iPhones, the answers of Amazon's Alexa, and numerous other applications. In 2011, his team was the first to win official computer vision contests through deep neural nets, with superhuman performance. In 2012, they had the first deep NN to win a medical imaging contest (on cancer detection). All of this attracted enormous interest from industry. His research group also established the fields of mathematically rigorous universal AI and recursive self-improvement in metalearning machines that learn to learn (since 1987). In 1990, he introduced unsupervised adversarial neural networks that fight each other in a minimax game to achieve artificial curiosity (GANs are a special case). In 1991, he introduced very deep learning through unsupervised pre-training, and neural fast weight programmers formally equivalent to what's now called linear Transformers. His formal theory of creativity &amp; curiosity &amp; fun explains art, science, music, and humor. He also generalized algorithmic information theory and the many-worlds theory of physics, and introduced the concept of Low-Complexity Art, the information age's extreme form of minimal art. He is recipient of numerous awards, author of over 350 peer-reviewed papers, and Chief Scientist of the company NNAISENSE, which aims at building the first practical general purpose AI. He is a frequent keynote speaker, and advising various governments on AI strategies.</p>
